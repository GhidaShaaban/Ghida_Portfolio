# [Project 1: Student Managment System ](https://github.com/GhidaShaaban/Student_Management_System)
<ul>
<strong>This project was executed while I was in a coding bootcamp to implement what we've been taught about PHP language.
It is indeed meticulous how with an arrangement of functions, loops, numbers... we were able
to form a website for students to ease their university experience and provide service in data management, communications, and scheduling!</strong>
